# What is this
PGtapme is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) tool for generating [pgTAP](https://pgtap.org/) style tests using a [PostgreSQl](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. It provides a modular and extensible framework to create tests for different aspects of your database schema. These tests can then be executed using [pg_prove docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/itheory/pg_prove/).

# Why do this - re-invent the wheel?
I did this to for a few reasons:
* To learn [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* But more so to learn the intricacies of [pgTAP](https://pgtap.org/) (inside [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), not the [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) code)
* I don't like the output format [pg_tapgen](https://github.com/theory/tap-parser-sourcehandler-pgtap/blob/v3.36/bin/pg_tapgen) produces
* So I had to learn [pgTAP]() and [pg_prove]() Perl code anyway :)
